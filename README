This is a quick and dirty set of skeleton JS, CSS, and markup to enable rapidly building out markup for sites.

It's worth mentioning that this is a very focused effort based on my recurring needs. It won't be everything to everyone, and IE6 isn't even a blip on the radar. We all like to do things a certain way, and so, while inspired by many others, this is simply a template built from the ground up so that I'm intimately familiar with what it does and doesn't do.

IMPORTANT: Using this relies running .html pages through Apache in order to handle server side includes which I lean on heavily. This makes it easier to develop reusable parts when developing markup templates for a site. Normally, the extension on the html files would be ".shtml", but I simply prefer ".html" and setup my local Apache configuration accordingly.

Remaining tasks are...

* Additional Common HTML Patterns (Blog Post Summary, Sidebar Article List, etc.)
* Add Generic Responsive Framework Pieces (http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/)
* iPhone/Mobile Preparedness (Mobile Safari specific elements)
